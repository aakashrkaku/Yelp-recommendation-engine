# Yelp-recommendation-engine
The project compares different recommendation algorithms for recommending restaurants to Yelp users.

The challenge in this project was the sparsity of the rating matrix which needed to be completed. Since the matrix ws very sparse, traditional techniques like SVD, Cosine Similarity based methods and ALS didn't perform well. Some advanced techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent Based Model, Neural Network Based model and Random Forest Regressor was used to achieve greater accuracy and a lower MSE. Finally, an ensemble of models was used achieve a best model to perform the recommendation task.
